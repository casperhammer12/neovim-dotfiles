HAMMERVIM - A NEOVIM CONFIG
---------------------------
This is my personal Neovim config
It features:
* A YAML file for installing plugins (Currently does not support config and init commands)
* packer.nvim as a plugin manager
* Currently 0 lazy-loading

EDITING
-------
CONFIG.yaml can be used to edit
